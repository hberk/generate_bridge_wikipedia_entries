To find a player, go to the directory that starts with the same letter as their _first_ anem.

For example, to find "Bob Hamman" go to the B directory.

GitHub imposes a limit of 1,000 files per directory so had to split up the files this way.

Some players have multiple entries, see the alternative_names.csv file in the directory aboe this.

The names of the files correspond to the name that is listed when they win an event, hence "Bob Hamman" and not "Robert Hamman".
